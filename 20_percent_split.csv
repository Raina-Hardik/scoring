12.9,How do you delete a node from a binary search tree?,"Find the node, then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtree (or the rightmost node from its left subtree).","if the node is a leaf, you set it's parent's pointer to null. if the node is in the tree you must replace the node with one in the tree: either the largest in the left of the tree or the smallest in the right of the tree. this can be done recursively if needed.",5,5,5
12.9,How do you delete a node from a binary search tree?,"Find the node, then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtree (or the rightmost node from its left subtree).","You traverse the tree till you find the node you are wanting to delete.  If the node has no children you delete it.  If the node has children, before you delete, you find the left-most of its children and attach it to the root then you can delete the node.",3.5,4.25,3.875
12.9,How do you delete a node from a binary search tree?,"Find the node, then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtree (or the rightmost node from its left subtree).","Traverse the tree and find the node, if the node has no children, simply delete it; otherwise set the node's data equal to the data of one of its children then set the pointer for that child to NULL.",3,3.75,3.375
12.9,How do you delete a node from a binary search tree?,"Find the node, then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtree (or the rightmost node from its left subtree).","If the node is a leaf, just set it's parent's pointer to null and delete it, if it has a single child, set the parent's pointer to the child and delete; if it has two children, set the node to one of the middle children and remove that child from its previous position as a leaf (rightmost child of the left subtree or leftmost child of the right subtree).",5,5,5
